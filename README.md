# Interaction Design in Defra

Interaction designers design the detailed actions a user needs to make in order to use a service. They are comfortable working at both ends of the scale, from high level flows and journeys to the detail of individual elements on screen. 


#### DDaT definition:

An interaction designer works out the best way to let users interact with services, in terms of both overall flow and at the level of individual design elements.


### Scope

* touchpoints
* user journeys 
* actions
* tasks

### Scale/zoom

* high level - User journey maps
* mid level - Flow diagram, Interaction sequence, Screen sequence, Question sequence
* low level - Structure, Screen layout, Components


### Goal

* visualise a users perspective
* highlight pain points
* highlight areas for improvement
* design how users interact with services

### focus

* users
* context
* situations
* when/where
* time
* inclusivity
* accessibility
* useability

## Relationship with Service design

Service design works across the whole service as a system mapping, joining up, and making tangible front-and-backstage processes that enable a user to achieve their goal

#### DDaT definition:

Service designers design the end-to-end journey of a service. This helps a user complete their goal and government deliver a policy intent. Their work may involve the creation of, or change to, transactions, products and content across both digital and offline channels provided by different parts of government.
